# Sweatshop

Sweatshop is an agile method where you outsource all your work to children. 
I smell regulatory trouble, but let me tell you how to avoid this.
Your company may have a policy against child labour but I bet four children 
that they don't have a policy against slavery. And if you don't pay the kids, 
it's not child labour but slavery.

## Exemplary delivery
1. Announce company family day
2. Invite children to the special children zone
3. Let them do all the work
4. Give them some candy as reward
5. Sell some of the children to belgium to refinance your effort
