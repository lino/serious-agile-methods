# Pharmacist

Pharmacist is an agile method derived from Fear and Loathing in your meeting but adapted for the boring clients with a more
compliance oriented approach. Instead of illegal drugs only FDA approved drugs are abused.

## Exemplary delivery

1. Buy a shitload of approved drugs
2. Distribute them in the meeting
3. Watch everyone fall asleep
4. Don't overdose

Always remember, the customer can't tell how many hours you bill while they're sound asleep.

## Bonus round
Combine uppers and downers to push your customers to the next level.
