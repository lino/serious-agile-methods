# Fear and loathing in your meeting

Fear and loathing in your meeting is an agile method facilitating traditional perception-changing substances which have been used
in corporate culture for years. Moving the consumption from the secrecy of the bathroom stall (nasal consumption or intravenous delivery) or the executive parking lot (inhalation) to the meeting room empowers the team to open up and improve trust while keeping the bathrooms available for spontaneous release of bodily fluids.

## Exemplary delivery
1. Buy a suitcase full of drugs.
2. Go to a meeting.
3. Put the suitcase on the table.
4. Take all the drugs.
5. Don't overdose.
6. Don't let the security service catch you barefoot in front of your office building.
