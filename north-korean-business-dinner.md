# North korean business dinner

It is no secret for a true business consultant that the glorious Democratic People's Republic of North Korea 
is in fact the best Korea. It's about time that we learn from the great leadership methods employed by
our friends. This method will help you motivate your staff by reducing headcount. Timeboxing is optional but recommended 
unless you want to reduce the headcount of the coached team to zero.

## Materials required
- Room (lockable)
- Dinner table
- Dishes
- No cook
- No food
- Firearms (Recommended: Anti Aircraft Artillery)

## Exemplary delivery
The business consultant invites the clueless and gullible team to a north korean business dinner in a room with lockable doors
and / or windows. The room is locked. An announcement is made that dinner is about to be served and if timeboxing is employed
how long this meeting will take. Of course dinner will never be served, as no food is the traditional local delicacy of North Korea.
Any participant trying to disrupt the agile process of the north korean business dinner will be shot with the firearms, if
the consultants don't want to do actual work for their money they can outsource the killing process to an anonymous henchman provided by one of the usual human resource staffers (Senior Lead Delivery Manager)
